Developer's Note: 

This project was originally created in my second year as a purely command-line-based application. But I felt that keeping it solely CLI-driven made it look a bit boring and limited in terms of user experience.So, I decided to add a fun twist and make it more presentable by turning it into a full-stack project. I deliberately chose technologies I wasn’t familiar with — just to learn something new and get my hands dirty by practicing. That’s how I landed on the tech stack mentioned above. From shelves to servers — managing libraries smarter. 📕📚
